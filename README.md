# 📘 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 🔍 Introduction

This repository serves as a practical simulation of the **requirement analysis phase** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), focusing on a **Booking Management System**. It documents the process of gathering, analyzing, and modeling software requirements using industry-standard practices and tools.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how clear, structured, and validated requirements lay the foundation for successful software development. It includes detailed documentation of functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, user stories, acceptance criteria, and supporting diagrams.

## 📌 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a foundational phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where the project team gathers, evaluates, and documents the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It involves understanding what the system should do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements), ensuring the development team builds the right product.

This phase acts as a bridge between the client’s vision and the technical implementation. It ensures all stakeholders—developers, clients, project managers, and users—share a common understanding of the system’s goals, constraints, and expected behavior.

### 🧠 Key Objectives of Requirement Analysis:

- **Identify and define the scope** of the system.
- **Gather requirements** from all relevant stakeholders.
- **Document requirements** clearly and unambiguously.
- **Analyze and prioritize** features based on business value and feasibility.
- **Validate requirements** to ensure completeness and correctness.

### 🔍 Importance in the SDLC:

| Benefit                                    | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Clarity and Alignment**               | Ensures everyone understands what is being built and why.                 |
| 🧱 **Foundation for Design & Development** | Provides a blueprint for system architecture and functionality.           |
| 💰 **Accurate Estimation**                 | Helps in planning budgets, timelines, and resources effectively.          |
| 🔒 **Scope Control**                       | Prevents scope creep by setting clear boundaries and expectations.        |
| 📈 **Improved Quality**                    | Leads to better testing, fewer defects, and higher customer satisfaction. |

Without a thorough requirement analysis, projects risk miscommunication, rework, budget overruns, and ultimately, failure to meet user needs. Therefore, requirement analysis is not just the first step—it's the **cornerstone of successful software development**.
