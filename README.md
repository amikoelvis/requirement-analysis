# 📘 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 🔍 Introduction

This repository serves as a practical simulation of the **requirement analysis phase** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), focusing on a **Booking Management System**. It documents the process of gathering, analyzing, and modeling software requirements using industry-standard practices and tools.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how clear, structured, and validated requirements lay the foundation for successful software development. It includes detailed documentation of functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, user stories, acceptance criteria, and supporting diagrams.
